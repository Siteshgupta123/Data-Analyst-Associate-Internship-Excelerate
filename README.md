##  Introduction
This repository captures my 4-week journey at Excelerate as part of Team 22, alongside my teammate Neha Sunil.
We explored real datasets, cleaned and transformed raw tables, and built an interactive Looker Studio Dashboard that turns data into decision-making power.

## Week-by-Week Progress
### **Week 1: Problem Understanding & Dataset Exploration**
- Explored 6 raw datasets provided.
- **Identified key challenges**: duplicate values, inconsistent date formats, and unclear application status codes.
- **Drafted initial problem statement**: “How can we simplify learner application tracking and give management a clear view of conversions, cohorts, and regions?”
-----------
## Week 2: ETL & Master Table Creation
- Performed data cleaning and standardization:
- Fixed date formats.
- Handled missing values.
- Removed duplicates.
- Designed a Mapping Table that linked all 6 datasets into a unified Master Table.

**Outcome**: A clean dataset ready for visualization

-----------------
## Week 3: Wireframe & Dashboard Draft
- Built the wireframe layout for our dashboard.
- Connected Looker Studio with the Master Table.
- Designed first version of visualizations (KPIs + charts).
- Collected feedback:
  - Strength: Clean design, correct integration.
  - Gap: Insights lacked depth and business storytelling.
-----------
## Week 4: Final Dashboard & Insights
This week, we went all in: refined metrics, added interactivity, and focused on business insights.
#### The final dashboard is structured into two pages:
- **Page 1 – Application Insights Overview**

- Application Status KPIs
  -  Total Applications: 1,200+
  -  Accepted Applications: ~85
  -  Rejected Applications: Remaining share
  -  Conversion Rate: ~82%
    - `This shows how effectively applications are being converted into accepted learners.`

- Applications Over Time (Line Chart)
  - Displays the monthly trend of applications.
  - Peaks observed around March 2024 indicating seasonal spikes.
  - Helps management plan campaigns around high-traffic periods.
  
- Top Performing Subjects (Bar Chart)
  - Highlighted subjects like Data Science & Business Analytics contributed the most applications.
  - These can be leveraged for future marketing.
---------------------
- **Page 2 – Regional & Cohort Analysis**

-**Region with Highest Conversion (Map/Bar)**
  - Regions like South Zone showed maximum conversion efficiency.
  - Regions with lower conversion need customized outreach.
-**Lead Source Effectiveness (Donut Chart)**
  - Best-performing lead source: Referrals (45%), followed by Direct Website (30%).
  - Paid campaigns underperformed, highlighting scope for optimization.
- **Cohort Size & Conversion (KPI + Chart)**
  - Average Cohort Size: ~45 learners.
  - Cohorts with balanced size showed higher success rates.
  - Helps academic planners optimize batch sizes.

## My Contributions

- Fixed Application Status logic (converted numeric codes → Accepted/Rejected).
- Built ETL pipeline in Power Query for Master Table.
- Designed KPIs & Filters in Looker Studio (Application Conversion Rate, Cohort Size, Subject Diversity).
- Drafted data storytelling slides for the final presentation.
- Ensured the dashboard was interactive & insight-rich.
-----------------
## Key Business Impact
- Turned 6 scattered datasets → 1 unified Master Table.
- Surfaced top 3 subjects driving applications.
- Identified region-wise conversion gaps for targeted campaigns.
- Showed 82% conversion rate with average 45 learners per cohort, guiding resource allocation.
- Dashboard now works as a decision-support tool for academic management.
-------------
## Learnings
- Hands-on with Looker Studio, ETL pipelines, KPI building.
- Learned to convert raw data → actionable insights.
- Experienced the importance of feedback & iteration (Week 3 → Week 4 improvement).
- Improved storytelling & visualization skills.
-------------
## Acknowledgments
- **Kolawole Oparinde Sir** – For expert guidance and sharp feedback.
- **Javeria Menon Mam** – For constant support and direction.
- **Team 22** ( Neha Sunil, Jayasree Chakraborthy, Sujay Kumar) – For collaboration, shared learning, and execution.

✨ This dashboard project reflects our 4-week journey of learning, problem-solving, and creating something impactful.
